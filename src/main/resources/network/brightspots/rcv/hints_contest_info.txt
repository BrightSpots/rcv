Hints for this tab

The tabulator calculates results for one contest at a time, rather than the results of several contests for an election all at once. The information on this tab is for the particular contest you will be tabulating.

These fields do not influence the computations. They are shown in the final output file(s) to help connect the data (results) with the contest the results belong to. 

* Think long term, e.g. from the perspective of looking at the results files 6 months after the election and wanting to be clear what contest the results belong to.

* You may find it helpful to revisit this tab once you have done a few test runs and see what the output looks like.
