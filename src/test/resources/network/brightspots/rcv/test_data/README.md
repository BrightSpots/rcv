# RCV Software Testing Suite
A collection of test data for RCV software.
This repo is in-progress and does not do anything yet. The README will be updated when it does.

## Tabulation test data
Each test contains three files:
1. A Cast Vote Record file
2. A configuration file
3. An output summary file

### Cast Vote Records
Cast Vote Records come in many formats. Your tabulator should support each of these formats.

### Configuration File
These files describe configuration options for the tabulator, including how to read the CVR, a list of candidates, and rules for how to conduct the tabulation.

### Output Summary File
The output file is in the [URCVT format](https://rcvformats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
