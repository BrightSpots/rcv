Hints for this tab

Tell the tabulator where results files go and what additional results files you want.

Output directory: The location where results files will go. If no value (or a relative path, like "output") is supplied, the location where the config file is saved will be used as the base directory. Absolute paths, like "C:\output" work too.

Tabulate by Precinct: Produce round-by-round results at the precinct level. Results are how ballots at the precinct level transferred in the contest as a whole, not a simulated round-by-round count in the precinct. Requires precinct information in CVR Files tab.

Generate a CDF JSON: Produce a VVSG common data format JSON file of the CVR.
