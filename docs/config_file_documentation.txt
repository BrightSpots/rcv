  - *filePath: the location of the file. Example: test/2015-portland-mayor-cvr.xlsx
  - *firstVoteColumnIndex: the index of the column that contains each ballot’s top-ranked candidate. Example: 3
  - precinctColumnIndex: the index of the column that contains each ballot's precinct name. Example: 2
  - *provider: the voting machine format of the file. Example: ES&S

- *rules: a set of options that determine exactly how the program should implement the instant runoff.
  - *batchElimination: whether batch elimination should be used. Valid options: true, false.
  - decimalPlacesForVoteArithmetic: how many places after the decimal to use in rounding for fractional vote transfer arithmetic in multi-winner elections. (defaults to 4)
  - description: the name of the set of the rules. Example: Maine Rules
  - *maxRankingsAllowed: the maximum number of candidates that a ballot is allowed to rank. Example: 15
  - *maxSkippedRanksAllowed: the maximum number of skipped ranks (i.e. undervotes) on a ballot before the ballot should be considered exhausted. Example: 1
  - minimumVoteThreshold: the minimum number of votes a candidate must receive in the first round to avoid automatic elimination. Example: 150
  - multiSeatTransferRule: how to handle vote transfers. Required if numberOfWinners is more than 1. Valid options: transferFractionalSurplus, transferWholeSurplus.
  - numberOfWinners: the number of seats to be won in this election. (defaults to 1)
  - overvoteLabel: the special label used in the cast vote records to denote an overvote. Example: OVERVOTE (Note: if this parameter is present, overvoteRule must be set to either alwaysSkipToNextRank or exhaustImmediately.)
  - *overvoteRule: how the program should handle an overvote when it encounters one. Valid options: alwaysSkipToNextRank, exhaustImmediately, exhaustIfAnyContinuing, ignoreIfAnyContinuing, exhaustIfMultipleContinuing, ignoreIfMultipleContinuing.
  - *tiebreakMode: how the program should decide which candidate to eliminate when multiple candidates are tied for last place among continuing candidates in a given round. Valid options: random, interactive, previousRoundCountsThenRandom, previousRoundCountsThenInteractive.
  - undeclaredWriteInLabel: the special label used in the cast vote records to denote a vote for an undeclared write-in. Example: UWI
  - undervoteLabel: the special label used in the cast vote records to denote an undervote. Example: UNDERVOTE
  - continueUntilTwoCandidatesRemain:
    keep tabulating beyond selecting winner until only two candidates remain.
      used to provide additional context for the strength of support for the winner.
    only valid for single-winner contests
    default: FALSE

- *candidates: a list of the candidates who appear in the cast vote records. Each candidate must have a name. If the cast vote records use candidate codes, each candidate must also have a code.
- *cvrFileSources: a list of the cast vote record source files. Each file must have three fields:
  - *provider: the voting machine format of the file. Example: ES&S
  - *filePath: the location of the file. Example: test/2015-portland-mayor-cvr.xlsx
  - *firstVoteColumnIndex: the index of the column that contains each ballot’s top-ranked candidate. Example: 3
-- multi-seat:
  - if numberOfWinners is specified AND it is more than 1 this will be a multi-seat tabulation
  - numberOfWinners: Integer how many winners will be picked in this elections
  - for multi-seat you must specify a multiSeatTransferRule
  - multiSeatTransferRule: must be either "transferFractionalSurplus" or "transferWholeSurplus"
    currently we only support "transferFractionalSurplus"
  - decimalPlacesForVoteArithmetic: how many places to do rounding when computing the size of
    fractional vote transfers.  Optional.  Defaults to 4 places.
- tabulateByPrecinct: whether the tabulator should generate a results spreadsheet for each precinct. (defaults to false)
- *visualizerOutput: the filename for the Excel spreadsheet with a summary of the results that the program will create. Example: portland_2015_mayor_visualizer.xlsx
