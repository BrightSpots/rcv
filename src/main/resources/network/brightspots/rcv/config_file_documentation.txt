  "rules" required
    set of configuration parameters that specify the tabulation rules
    the "rules" section contains the following parameters:

      "tiebreakMode" required
        how the program should decide which candidate to eliminate when multiple candidates are tied for last place
        or which candidate to elect first when:
          1) electionWinnerMode is set to multiSeatAllowOnlyOneWinnerPerRound, and
          2) multiple candidates exceed the winning threshold in the same round, and
          3) at least two of those candidates are tied for the highest vote total in that round
        value: "random" | "interactive" | "previousRoundCountsThenRandom" | "previousRoundCountsThenInteractive" | "usePermutationInConfig" | "generatePermutation"

        we use java.util.random for randomness in our tiebreak implementations
        see: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Random.html
        compatible methods exist for other languages, e.g. https://pypi.org/project/java-random/
        on tabulation start a java.util.Random object is created if required using the randomSeed value specified in the input config file:
          Random random = new Random(config.getRandomSeed());

        "random"
          during tabulation, in the event of a tie at the end of a round:
          the list of tied candidates is sorted alphabetically
          a randomDouble is generated using the random object:
            double randomDouble = random.nextDouble();
          the randomDouble is mapped to one of the tied candidates in the list:
            int randomCandidateIndex = (int) Math.floor(randomDouble * (double) tiedCandidates.size());
          the selected candidate will be the winner or loser for that round

        "interactive":
          the user is presented with a list of tied candidates
          the user will input their selection manually

        "previousRoundCountsThenRandom"
          the tied candidate with the highest vote total in the previous round is selected
          if there is a tie for the vote count in the previous round as well, a candidate is selected from the still tying candidates as described under tiebreakMode "random"

        "previousRoundCountsThenInteractive"
          the tied candidate with the highest vote total in the previous round is selected
          if there is a tie for the vote count in the previous round as well, a candidate is selected from the still tying candidates as described under "interactive"

        "usePermutationInConfig"
          during tabulation, in the event of a tie at the end of a round the list of candidates from the config file is consulted
          if selecting a winner the tied candidate in this round who appears earliest is selected as a winner
          if selecting a loser the tied candidate who appears latest is selected as the loser

        "generatePermutation"
          on config load candidate names are sorted alphabetically by candidate code, or if code is not present, candidate name
          a randomly ordered candidate permutation is created using Collections.shuffle() with the randomSeed specified in the input config file
          during tabulation, in the event of a tie at the end of a round, this permutation is consulted
          if selecting a winner: the tied candidate in this round who appears earliest is selected
          if selecting a loser: the tied candidate who appears latest is selected

      "overvoteRule" required
        how the program should handle an overvote when it encounters one
        value: "alwaysSkipToNextRank" | "exhaustImmediately" | "exhaustIfMultipleContinuing"

      "winnerElectionMode" required
        whether the program should apply a special process for selecting the winner(s)
        value: "standard" | "singleSeatContinueUntilTwoCandidatesRemain" | "multiSeatAllowOnlyOneWinnerPerRound" | "multiSeatBottomsUp" | "multiSeatSequentialWinnerTakesAll"
        "standard": no special process
        "singleSeatContinueUntilTwoCandidatesRemain": keep tabulating after the winning round until only two candidates remain (only valid when numberOfWinners = 1)
        "multiSeatAllowOnlyOneWinnerPerRound": elect no more than one winner per round, even when there are multiple candidates exceeding the winning threshold (only valid when numberOfWinners > 1)
        "multiSeatBottomsUp": instead of running a standard multi-seat contest with single transferable votes, just eliminate candidates until either a) there are numWinners remaining or b) all remaining candidates have vote shares that meet or exceed multiSeatBottomsUpPercentageThreshold (only valid when numberOfWinners is 0 or > 1)
        "multiSeatSequentialWinnerTakesAll": instead of running a true multi-seat contest, run a series of single-seat contests and progressively exclude candidates as they win seats (only valid when numberOfWinners > 1)

      "numberOfWinners" required
        the number of seats to be won in this contest
        note: we use fractional vote transfer to redistribute votes in multi-seat contests
        note: 0 is valid only when winnerElectionMode is set to multiSeatBottomsUp
        value: [0..number of declared candidates]

      "decimalPlacesForVoteArithmetic" required
        number of rounding decimal places when computing winning thresholds and fractional vote transfers
        value: [1..20]

        value: [0..1000000]

      "maxSkippedRanksAllowed" required
        maximum number of skipped ranks (undervotes) on a ballot before the ballot should be considered exhausted; if "unlimited" is entered, a ballot will never be considered exhausted due to skipped ranks
        example: 1
        value: [unlimited, 0..1000000]

      "maxRankingsAllowed" required
        maximum number of candidates that a ballot is allowed to rank; if "max" is entered, this will default to the total number of declared candidates
        example: 15
        values: [max, 1..1000000]

      "randomSeed" required if tiebreakMode is random, previousRoundCountsThenRandom, or generatePermutation
        the integer seed for the application's pseudorandom number generator
        value: [-140737488355328..140737488355327]

      "overvoteLabel" optional
        label used in the CVR to denote an overvote; if this parameter is present overvoteRule must be either "alwaysSkipToNextRank" or "exhaustImmediately" (because the other option, exhaustIfMultipleContinuing, relies on knowing which specific candidates were involved in each overvote)
        example: "OVERVOTE"
        value: string of length [1..1000]

      "undervoteLabel" optional
        the special label used in the cast vote records to denote an undervote

        also used to represent undeclared write-ins in the results output
        example: "UWI"
        value: string of length [1..1000]

      "multiSeatBottomsUpPercentageThreshold" required if winnerElectionMode is multiSeatBottomsUp and numberOfWinners is 0
        the percentage threshold used to determine when to stop the tabulation and declare winners
        note: only valid when winnerElectionMode is multiSeatBottomsUp and numberOfWinners is 0
        value: [1..100]

      "rulesDescription" optional
        text description of this rules configuration for organizing your config files -- not used by the tabulator
        Example "Maine Rules"
        value: string of length [1..1000]

      "nonIntegerWinningThreshold" optional
        the vote threshold used to determine winners can be a non-integer
        if true, threshold = V/(S+1) + 10^-d
        if false, threshold = floor(V/(S+1)) + 1
        where V = total number of votes (in the current round for single-seat or in the first round for multi-seat); S = numberOfWinners; and d = decimalPlacesForVoteArithmetic
        (note that S+1 in the formulas above becomes just S if hareQuota is set to true)
        value: true | false
        if not supplied: false

      "hareQuota" optional
        the winning threshold should be computed using the Hare quota (votes divided by seats) instead of the preferred Droop quota (votes divided by (seats+1))

        value: true | false
        if not supplied: false

      "batchElimination" optional

        value: true | false
        if not supplied: false

      "exhaustOnDuplicateCandidate" optional
        tabulator will exhaust a ballot when it encounters a duplicate candidate (instead of just skipping the duplicate)

        tabulator will interpret a blank cell in a CVR as a vote for an undeclared write-in
        value: true | false
        if not supplied: false
