Universal Tabulator User Guide

Overview:

The Universal Tabulator is a free open source application designed to quickly and accurately tabulate ranked choice voting elections using a variety of rules commonly in use in North America.

The Tabulator requires as input a "contest configuration" file which specifies:
- Tabulation rule variations to use
- List of registered candidates 
- One or more cast vote record files
- Output formatting options (contest name, where to write output files, etc.)

The Tabulator produces as output:
- A results spreadsheet including round-by-round vote totals for each candidate and the eventual winner(s)
- An audit report describing how every ballot was counted in each round over the course of the tabulation

The Tabulator provides an interface for:
- Creating contest configuration files
- Validating contest configuration files to ensure they are well-formed, and all values are within expected ranges
- Tabulating a contest with a contest configuration file 

Launching the Tabulator:

Once you've downloaded or built the binary, double-click rcv.jar file to launch the GUI version of the Tabulator.
You may need to install Java SE Runtime Environment 10 first: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre10-downloads-4417026.html
Note that the Tabulator does not currently run in a Linux environment (see issue #168) or with Java 11 (#239). It should run properly on a Mac or Windows machine running Java 10.
You can also run the Tabulator from the command line by supplying an existing config file as the only runtime argument.

Loading and Tabulating a Contest:

The Tabulator includes several example contest configuration files and associated cast vote record files.
Click "Load..." at the top of the window and browse into the "test_data" folder under src/test/resources.
Browse into one of the folders listed here and select the corresponding file that ends with "_config.json".
Click on the configuration tabs (Output, CVR Files, Candidates, Rules) to see how this contest is configured.
Click "Validate" to check if this configuration is valid.  You will see the results in the black console area at the bottom of the main window.
Click "Tabulate" to tabulate the election.  You will see the results in the console, including the location and names of output files.

Viewing Tabulator outputs:

Tabulator output file names automatically include the current date and time, e.g. 2018-09-09_15-34-00_summary.xlsx.  This keeps them separate if you tabulate the same contest multiple times.
Look in the console window to see where the output spreadsheet was written, e.g.
2018-09-09 18:55:53 PDT INFO: Generating summary spreadsheet: /Users/Me/Documents/rcv/test_output/2018_maine_gov_primary_dem/2018-09-09_18-55-33_summary.xlsx
Double-click on the summary spreadsheet to open it.  You may have to install OpenOffice (or some other Excel file reader) first:

Find the audit log file and double-click on it to open it.  It is a standard text file and can be displayed with any kind of text editor.
