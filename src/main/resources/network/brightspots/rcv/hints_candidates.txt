Hints for this tab

Fill in the fields and click the Add button:

Name (required): E.g.: Dave Harris.

Codes or Aliases (optional): Enter one code or alias per line.
Codes are used by some CVR files in lieu of full candidate name. E.g.: "JCD" or "14".
Aliases are helpful when candidate names are not normalized across jurisdictions, e.g. "JAMES" may be an alias for "James".


Excluded (optional): When checked, the candidate will be ignored during tabulation. An example of when this might be used: a candidate dropped out after the ballots were printed.
