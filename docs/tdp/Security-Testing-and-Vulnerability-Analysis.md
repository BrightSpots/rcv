**Objective:** This document shall identify the threats the voting
system protects against and the implemented security controls on voting
system and system components.

**Identified Threats & Mitigation**

-   Equipment Failure - RCTab is used on COTS equipment. While equipment
    failure is rare, it should be recognized as a possibility.
    Jurisdiction backup and disaster plans should include strategies for
    handling equipment failures and replacements before they occur.

    -   See **RCTab v1.3.2 Section 03 - System Hardware Specification
        v.1.1.1** for minimum operating specifications and **RCTab
        v1.3.2 Section 16 - System Hardening Procedures - Windows OS
        v.1.3.0** for procedures to ensure the hardware is adequately
        protected against unauthorized access, theft of data, and/or
        malicious attacks.

    -   Following any maintenance or replacement of equipment used to
        operate RCTab, users should refer to **RCTab v1.3.2 Section 05 -
        Acceptance Test Procedures v.1.2.1.**

    -   The manufacturer also recommends conducting a post-installation
        and post-election hashing as outlined in **RCTab v1.3.2 Section
        23 - HashCode Instructions - Windows OS v.1.2.1.**

    -   If the user elects to use USB devices to move installation files
        and/or data to and from devices, the manufacturer recommends
        using instructions as outlined in **RCTab v1.3.2 Section 32 -
        Secure USB Process v.1.0.1.**

-   Unauthorized Access - Software itself is vulnerable to attack if
    someone gains access to the tabulation computer/RCTab workstation
    without jurisdiction approval or knowledge because of violation of
    access controls

    -   Users should only access the software per jurisdiction approved
        rules and after users have obtained the recommended training as
        outlined in **RCTab v1.3.2 Section 10 - Personnel Deployment and
        Training v.1.2.1**. See also **RCTab v1.3.2 Section 07 - System
        Security Specification Requirements v.1.4.0.**

    -   When used with Hart Verity, RCTab 1.3.2 includes the following
        programmatic security mechanisms

        -   When tabulation begins, RCTab automatically,
            programmatically verifies the cryptographic signature of all
            Hart CVRs used as input for contest tabulation. This
            verification step ensures both the integrity (CVR contents
            have not been edited) and provenance (CVRs came from the
            Hart voting system) of the Hart CVRs. RCTab will throw a
            halting error and tabulation will not begin if cryptographic
            validation of Hart’s CVR signature is not successful. This
            is to protect against tampering of CVRs between Hart Verity
            export and RCTab import by malicious internal actors.

        -   After successfully following installation instructions in
            **RCTab v1.3.2 Section 22 - Installation Instructions for
            Windows OS v.1.3.0** *only* the RCTab software is run with
            administrator privileges, the logged in Windows user does
            **not** have administrative privileges. All RCTab output
            files (audit logs, summary .csv and .json, corresponding
            .hash files) are programmatically set to Read-Only and
            cannot be edited by the RCTab Windows Standard user.  
              
            This is to protect against any tampering with the content of
            the summary files or audit log by malicious internal actors.
            This also ensures that the tabulation user does not have
            admin-level OF privileges to make changes that could be
            security issues e.g. disabling read-only access or enabling
            network adaptors.

        -   Additionally, RCTab automatically, programmatically creates
            a cryptographic hash of all output files - audit logs,
            summary .csv and .json - that can be used to validate that
            those files have not been edited. This is to protect against
            any tampering with the content of the summary files and
            audit log.

    <!-- -->

    -   The objective of these programmatic and procedural security
        improvements is to make the execution of malicious tampering so
        onerous that it will not be a viable target. The combination of
        procedural and new programmatic controls require significantly
        more time and complexity for any malicious actor - this makes
        RCTab a less appealing target. Additionally, these procedural
        and programmatic controls make auditing a tabulation to ensure
        secure, successful execution easier and quicker.

    -   Though perfect security is the goal of RCTab, threats still
        exist. Certain programmatic requirements continue to require
        procedural steps. Not following the procedural steps could make
        it easier for a malicious actor to tamper with an election. For
        example, **RCTab v1.3.2 Section 22 - Installation Instructions
        for Windows OS v.1.3.0** describes explicitly setting
        permissions for the RCTab output folder to ensure read only
        access. If this is not done - either by not setting permissions
        during installation, or by configuring RCTab during tabulation
        to use a different folder - RCTab users cannot edit RCTab output
        but they can delete RCTab output. Someone could

        -   Copy the contents of the output

        -   Create a new file

        -   Edit the contents of that new file

        -   Delete the original file

        -   Then rename the edited file to the original

> But this is mitigated by the other security additions to v1.3.2. To
> successfully tamper with the summary.csv file for example, a malicious
> actor must also

-   Rehash the edited file, delete the corresponding .hash file and
    recreate it with the new hash

-   Delete the summary.json file, recreate it with the same edits to
    summary.csv, hash the summary.json file, delete it’s corresponding
    .hash file and recreate it with the edited hash

-   Find the audit\_X.log, copy its contents to a new file, search
    through it to find and edit original hashes of the output files,
    rehash the audit\_X.log, delete the corresponding audit\_X.log.hash,
    and recreate it with the edited hash, delete the original
    audit\_X.log and rename the edited one

> And all of these steps described above would be moot if installation
> instruction procedures are properly followed and permissions on the
> output folder set correctly. In that case, all RCTab output files are
> read only and cannot be edited, deleted, or recreated by the user
> running the tabulation.

-   Incorrect assignment of RCV rules as set by the jurisdiction -
    Jurisdictions establish rules for interpreting and counting ranked
    choice voting results. Failure to correctly set up the RCTab
    configuration file according to jurisdiction requirements could lead
    to incorrect results.

    -   Pre-election testing should be performed as per jurisdiction
        policies and procedures. Instructions for conducting those tests
        can be found at **RCTab v1.3.2 Section 11 - L&A Testing
        v.1.3.2.**
